## Unit Testing
- The simple test is in the "Unit testing" folder. It is a simple test for a calculator and employee class.
## Intergartion Testing
- Integration testing is the process of testing the interface between two software units or modules. It focuses on determining the correctness of the interface. The purpose of integration testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units. Once all the modules have been unit-tested, integration testing is performed.

## Functional Testing
- Functional testing is a quality assurance (QA) process and a type of black-box testing that bases its test cases on the specifications of the software component under test. Functions are tested by feeding them input and examining the output, and internal program structure is rarely considered (not like white-box testing). Functional testing usually describes what the system does.
